# browserify-paths2ids

convert paths in a browserify-bundle into hex-ids

```
$ npm i browserify guybrush/browserify-paths2ids
$ browserify client.js | browserify-paths2ids > client.bundle.js
```

this is not on npm and not so much doc because its not done (and actually
not worth it - on my project i get from 817kb to 808kb)
